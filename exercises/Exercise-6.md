# Exercise 5: Mocking hooks and data 

For this exercise, we are going to add tests for the `Counter` component found in `src/Counter.js`.

As in the previous exercises, the component is already written and functioning, but there are not yet any tests for it.

Create a file `src/Counter.spec.js` and add all the tests that you need to specify the component's *data-loading and display* behavior.

## Designing Your Tests

Write a unit tests for this component using Jest and React Testing Library, and mock the useCounter hook
