# Exercise 5: Testing Hooks

For this exercise, we are going to add tests for the `CounterHook` component found in `src/useCounter.js`.

The custom hook is already written and functioning, but there are not yet any tests for it.

Create a file `src/CounterHook.spec.js` and add all the tests that you need to specify the hook behavior.
